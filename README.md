# HelpMate - ShowCode Hackathon 2021
## Inspiration
As programmers we often use tools such as **Stack Overflow** to find people who have had similar problems to us and learn from their solutions. However, sometimes you can find someone with the same problem as you and nobody has found a solution. We have decided to use **Gamification** to incentivize users to help each other.
 ## What it does
This application **connects people** with each other. They can **learn new topics, ask things related to their studies**. People can **like someone's solution** if they find it working. Users can **make their position on the leader board**. They can **use their profile in their resumes/CV to make a good impression on the Employer** and show their area of expertise. Users are encouraged to help other users in a friendly but competitive way through gamification using a leader board. Users can also **interact through video calls** to allow more help than sites such as StackOverflow can provide.

## How we built it
 - The front-end application is created using **Flutte**r so the app can be used across **both Android & iOS Mobile Platforms**
 - The Application data is stored using **Google Firebase** which allows developers to store **JSON objects** in a database in a **similar fashion to MongoDB**
 - Our developers collaborated using **Scrum Techniques over Trello**, code was worked out collaboratively using **GitHub**.

## Challenges we ran into
- **Two team members dropped out of the competition due to mental health** - which is understandable considering the pandemic, and we don't blame them at all.
- **One team member disappeared** - it is what it is, we always had that risk when working with people met online.
- **Forgot to .gitignore the build folder** which lead to  issues
- **Thinking of ideas** we took about 4-5 hours on the first day on the idea thinking of an idea
- **IDE Setup** - Wasted a lot of time setting up the Flutter Environment during the hackathon
- **Code Style / File Structure** - Different people have different code styles and structure their files in different ways, after a day of working on the project we decided to sit down and agree on how we structure the files so it is consistent.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

 - **Functioning MVC Cross-platform Flutter application** made within 48 hours
 - Still continuing and finishing the project despite members dropping out 
 - **0 merge conflicts as far as I can remember**, we planned out who was doing what at what time meticulously so peoples work would not be overwritten.
 - Completed the Trello backlog despite losing members

## What we learned
- When looking for team members look for people who have had experience on group projects before to avoid complications, or some of their own unique software projects.
- Flutter
- Google FireBase API
- Flutter Agora Module for Video calls
- Good experience programming collaboratively

## What's next for HelpMate
 1. People would **help others** and they can **use their profile in their CV/Resume** to make a good impression on the employers.
 2. Users can **make friends and rate** when someone helps them on Video/Audio Calls.
 3. Users will have a healthy **competition** with their friends.
